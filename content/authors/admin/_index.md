I'm an MD-PhD student at the University of Washington, currently doing PhD research with Dr. Su-In Lee and the AIMS Lab. I'm interested in using machine learning methods to build clinical risk scores that are easier to use, more human-interpretable, and that better incorporate clinical domain knowledge.
